# Pub Crusade for Foundry VTT

A Foundry VTT System for the game [Pub Crusade](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/pub-crusade/?mc_cid=84e30af20e).

Mainly a practice project for me to iterate on my process for building FVTT systems.

Pub Crusade is copyright... Grant Howitt, or Rowan, Rook,& Decard. Anyway the name is used (currently) without permission. This system does *not* contain the original 1-page rules for the game. It's just a little character sheet.

## How to use

For now: head to the [releases page](https://github.com/n3dst4/pub-crusade-fvtt/releases) and grab the manifest URL for the latest release.

Paste it into the manifest URL field in the Foundry VTT "install a system" dialog.
