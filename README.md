Pub Crusade is copyright... Grant Howitt, or Rowan, Rook,& Decard. Anyway the name is used (currently) without permission. This system does *not* contain the original 1-page rules for the game. It's just a little character sheet.

## How to use

For now: head to the [releases page](https://github.com/n3dst4/pub-crusade-fvtt/releases) and grab the manifest URL for the latest release.

Paste it into the manifest URL field in the Foundry VTT "install a system" dialog.


## Handy hints

* Create a scene with the one-page rules (which includes the "map") as the background image.
* Add the "Encounters" and "Inn-counters" tables as Foundry roll tables.
* Use [this d100 table](https://d100tables.com/t/tavern-drinks) to generate random drinks at each pub.
* Supplement the built-in d6 "Inn-counters" table with [this d100 table](https://d100tables.com/t/tavern-events).
